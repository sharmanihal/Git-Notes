### Git Stash

The git stash command is a powerful tool in Git that allows you to temporarily save your changes in a "stash" so that you can work on something else and then come back to those changes later.

Say you have some local changes, and you want to switch branches but don't want the changes to come in the new switched branch, you can just stash the changes, switch branches, and come back to the original branch later, pull your stashed changes, and start working on them again.


1. Say you have some changes, not staged yet. But you want to switch branches and not want those changes to follow you to the new switched branch
2. Perform a stash on those changes

   ```
   git stash
   ```
   What does this git stash do? It will make your codebase reflect the latest commit i.e., to which the HEAD is pointing and all changes will be stashed in memory.

3. Switch branches, and complete work there.

4. Come back to the original branch.

5. Bring back those stashed changes :

   - List your stash to take a look at the stashes:
     ```
     git stash list
     ```

   - Bring the stashed changes back to your code base:
     ```
     git stash pop
     ```


**What if you stash multiple times?**

 You will be able to see multiple entries when you do `git stash list`

When you do git stash pop, the last stashed change will be popped and added to your working project.

**What if you don't want the stash to be popped(keep it in the stash), but want the changes to show which this stash carries?**

```
git stash apply
```

**What if you want to delete a particular entry in the stash? or want to clear the entire stash ?**

```
git stash drop <stash@index> , to delete a particular entry
or
git stash clear, to delete all entries of the stash
```

**What if you have multiple files that have changes and you want only a particular file to be stashed?**

```
git stash -- <file-name>

or we can also associate messages to our stash entry

git stash -m "message" -- <file-name>

This message is helpful when we have multiple entries in the stash and want a particular stash entry.
```

**What if you want a particular stash change and not the latest stash ?**

```
git stash apply <stash@index>
```

**Show me changes before bringing the code back from stash:**

```
git stash show <stash@index> // will just be the number of lines inserted/deleted etc
git stash show -p <stash@index> // will show the exact changes
```

**What if we only want to stash unstaged changes i.e., changes not yet staged using the `git add` command ?**

```
git stash --keep-index
```

**Also include untracked file in stashing:**

**Untracked file:** A new file created, never has been added to the stage, and has not been part of the codebase until yet.
**Unstaged file:** Already part of the codebase, but changes are done to it.

```
git stash --include-untracked
```
