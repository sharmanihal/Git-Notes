### Git Amend

Let's say you committed some of your changes, and later realized some more changes need to be added to that commit, i.e., you want to make changes to the commit or you want to amend the commit.


1. First add your changes to the staging area using :
   ```
   git add .
   or
   git add <file-name>
   ```

2. Amend the previous commit:
   ```
   git commit --amend
   ```

   This will open a screen with our previous commit message, we can add our new commit message to it and save.

   If you don't want to add this commit message separately, we can do :

   ```
   git commit --amend -m <commit-message-new>
   ```
