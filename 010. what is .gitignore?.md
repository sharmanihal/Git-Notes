### Git Ignore:

The .gitignore file is a special file in a Git repository that specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git. When you include files or directories in a .gitignore file, Git will not track changes to those files, and they will not be included in commits

**Purpose:** 

The primary purpose of .gitignore is to prevent certain files from being tracked and included in version control. This is useful for:

**Temporary Files:** Such as build artifacts, intermediate files, or temporary files generated by your development environment.

**Sensitive Information:** Such as configuration files with passwords or API keys.

**Local Environment Files:** Such as IDE-specific settings or local environment configurations that shouldn't be shared with others.

### Setup:

1. If ```.gitignore``` file is not already present, add this file to you root of the project.
   ```
   touch .gitignore
   ```
2. Ignore a directory and everything in it:

   Inside your `.gitignore` file:
   ```
   properties/

    / will tell git its a directory
   ```

3. Ignore a file:
   
   Inside your `.gitignore` file:
   ```
   password.txt
   ```

4. Ignore all files with a particular extension:
   Inside your `.gitignore` file:
   ```
   *.log
   ```

5. Ignore the `.gitignore` file from the commit as well
   Inside your `.gitignore` file:
   ```
   .gitignore
   ```
