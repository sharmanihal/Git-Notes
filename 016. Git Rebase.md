### Git Rebase

Letâ€™s walk through an example to illustrate why and how to use `git rebase` to keep your branch up-to-date without creating unnecessary merge commits.

### Scenario:
1. **Initial Setup:**
   - You have a `main` branch (equivalent to `master` in older Git versions).
   - You create a feature branch `feature-branch` from `main` to work on a new feature.

```sh
git checkout -b feature-branch
```

2. **Commits on the `main` Branch:**
   - While you're working on `feature-branch`, other developers continue to make commits to the `main` branch.

```sh
# Commit A, B, and C added to the main branch
```

3. **Work on `feature-branch`:**
   - You also make a few commits on your `feature-branch`.

```sh
# Commit D and E added to feature-branch
```

### Issue with Merging:
If you were to use `git merge` to keep your `feature-branch` up-to-date with `main`, youâ€™d end up with merge commits each time, which could clutter the commit history.

```sh
git checkout feature-branch
git merge main
# Creates a merge commit combining changes from main into feature-branch
```

### Using Rebase:
Instead, you can use `git rebase` to reapply your commits from `feature-branch` on top of the latest commits in `main`. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Fetch the Latest Changes:**
   ```sh
   git fetch origin
   ```

2. **Rebase `feature-branch` onto `main`:**
   ```sh
   git checkout feature-branch
   git rebase main 
   ```

### Result:
Rebasing takes your `feature-branch` commits (D and E) and re-applies them on top of the latest `main` branch commits (A, B, and C). This linearizes the commit history without creating merge commits.

```plaintext
main branch:    A---B---C
                \
feature-branch:  D'---E'
```

- **Before Rebase:**
  ```plaintext
  main branch:    A---B---C
                   \ 
  feature-branch:   D---E
  ```

- **After Rebase:**
  ```plaintext
  main branch:    A---B---C
                           \
  feature-branch:           D'---E'
  ```

### Advantages:
- **Clean History**: Your commit history remains clean and linear.
- **Avoid Merge Commits**: No unnecessary merge commits cluttering your history.
- **Easy to Read**: Itâ€™s easier to follow the project history and see the progression of changes.
