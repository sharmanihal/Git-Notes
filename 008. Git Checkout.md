### Git Checkout

- Switch branch using git checkout
  ```
  git checkout <branch-name>
  ```

- Create a branch using git checkout and switch to it
  ```
  git checkout -b <branch-name>

  similar to: git switch -c <branch-name>
  ```

 - Discard unstaged changes(not added using add command) using git checkout:
   ```
   git checkout <file-name>
   or
   git checkout .
   ```

  - Want to go to a particular commit:
    ```
    git checkout <commit-hash>
    ```
    **Important Notes:**
    
    **Detached HEAD State:** When you checkout a specific commit, Git will place you in a "detached HEAD" state. This means that you're not currently on any branch, but instead on the specified commit directly. Any changes you make in this state won't be associated with any branch unless you create a new branch from this commit.
    
    **Read-Only State:** While in a detached HEAD state, you can view and experiment with the project at that particular commit, but changes will not be saved to a branch unless you explicitly create a new branch.

    **Creating a New Branch:** If you want to make changes and keep them, you should create a new branch from this commit:
    ``` git checkout -b new-branch-name```

-  If you want to go n number of commits back from the head, you can do the:
    ```
    git checkout HEAD~n
    example git checkout HEAD~2 (Head will be detached and point to two commits back)

    You can check that using git log --oneline
    ```
