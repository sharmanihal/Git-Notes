### Git Merge:

Say we have created two branches out of the master branch :
1. logout branch: Has logout related code. (Does not have notfound code)
2. notFound branch: Has code related to NotFound page. (Does not have logout code)

So the branch tree looks something like this:

**Let's merge the logout code to the master branch:**

1. You need to first switch to the `master` branch i.e., the branch in which you want to merge the code.

    ``` git switch master```

2. Merge the logout branch with the master branch:

   ```
   git merge logout
   git merge <branch-name>
   ```

**You see when we merged it said:**

```FAST_FORWARD : UPDATING 96c2e4d to f7c1dd4.```

The master branch pointer has jumped forward to the logout branch pointer.

### Delete the branch

Since you are already done with the logout branch, we can simply delete the logout branch:

```
git branch -d logout
```

Since the logout branch was merged, it was redundant to keep it lying around.

But let's say if we try to delete the notFound branch, it will say :

### Merge Conflicts

Merging two branches that have nothing in common in terms of changes is straightforward.
But what if two branches have some common file modified? which modification should we keep?

Say, we want to merge notFound and master now, but on master, we have made some changes to the homepage, and on notFound also some changes to the homepage were made.

Let's try merging them:

1. Switch to the master branch
   ```
   git switch master
   ```
2. Merge both branches
   ```
   git merger notFound
   ```

If we visit the homepage file:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2531b36-1949-414e-8657-c8597cbe9ad3)

We will see changes from both branches (HEAD will show the master branch changes and notFound will show notFound branch changes)

You will have to manually remove and keep the changes you want.

### What happens if you switch branches with untracked changes:

### What happens if you switch branches with tracked changes:

script.js has been added to the staged area using the git add command
