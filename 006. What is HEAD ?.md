### What is head?

Head points to the latest commit in the current branch you are on.

### What was the use of Head when the branch name is already pointing to the latest commit of the branch?
The head is not stationary, as soon as you switch branch HEAD will start pointing to the latest commit of that branch.
It lets GIT know which branch you are currently on.

```
git branch
* main      # HEAD points here
  feature   # Both at same commit

# Without HEAD, Git wouldn't know:
- Which branch to update on commit
- Which branch's history to show
- Which branch's status to display
```

```
# Starting point:
HEAD → (main) → commit123
feature → commit123

# When you make a commit:
git commit -m "new change"

# Git knows to update main (not feature) because of HEAD
HEAD → main → commit123 → commit456
feature → commit123
```
