### Git Reset

If you want to play with the commit history of a branch you can use git reset.

**Usecases**

1. Unstage changes: You added some files to be committed, but changed your mind

   ```
   git add file1.txt file2.txt #Add files to the staging area
   git reset                   # Unstage the changes
   or
   git restore --staged .
   ```

2. Undo last commit: You committed something, but there's a mistake and you want to make changes before committing again.

   ```
   git commit -m "Incorrect commit" #Made a commit with a mistake
   git reset --soft HEAD~1 #Undo the last commit but keep the changes (in the staging area)

   git reset --mixed HEAD~1 #Undo the last commit but keep the changes (in the unstaged area)

   git reset --hard HEAD~1 #Undo the last commit but also discard all the changes of that commit.
   ```

   Flags:
     - Soft Flag: If you use a soft flag, the commit reset files will come to the staging area.
     - Mixed Flag: If you use the mixed flag, the commit reset files will come to the unstaged area.
     - Hard Flag: If you use the mixed flag, the commit reset files will be discarded.


3. Reset to a specific commit: You want to reset your code to a specific commit, keeping the changes in your working directory.

     ```
     git reset --soft <commit-hash>

     (Reset to a specific commit, keeping changes in the working directory)
     ```

4. Reset to a specific commit: You want to reset your code to a specific commit, keeping the changes in your unstaged directory.

     ```
     git reset --mixed <commit-hash>

     (Reset to a specific commit, keeping changes in the unstaged directory)
     ```

5. Reset to a specific commit: You want to reset your code to a specific commit, discarding all the changes. This will also remove all commits that were done after the commit, which you will select for resetting to.

     ```
     git reset --hard <commit-hash>

     (Reset to a specific commit, discard the changes)
     ```
