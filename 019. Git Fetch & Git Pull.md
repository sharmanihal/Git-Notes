### Get Fetch :

The git fetch command is used to download objects and refs (like branches and tags) from another repository, typically the remote repository. It doesn't modify your working directory or update your current branch; it just brings in the changes from the remote repository so you can integrate them into your local repository at your convenience.

```
git fetch
```

If any new branch is created or any changes to an existing branch are made git fetch will pull that information to our local.

If you want to see what branches are present in the remote repo:

```
git branch -r
```

Say something changes in your remote branch, or someone adds a new file or commits something. 
Our local branch would not know about these changes as it is not polling continuously to the remote branch.
To make sure we get the info on what has happened to our remote branch we can do

This will pull info only about the branch name specified
```
git fetch <branch-name>
```

If we do ``` git fetch``` only, then all local repos will be in sync and all new changes and branch info will be available in our local.

---
Say one new commit was added to the remote branch, when we do ` git status ` in the same branch in our local it will say:

You are x numbers of commits behind the remote repo.

We need to pull the latest changes from the remote repo:

This will only pull the latest changes of the specified branch name

```
git pull origin <branch-name>

If you do just git pull
It will take the origin automatically and the current branch
We can also rebase the branch
```

**Git Pull:** It is essentially a combination of two commands: git fetch followed by git merge. When you run git pull, Git fetches the changes from the remote repository and then merges them into your current branch.
