### Git Revert

The git revert command is used to create a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by a previous commit. Unlike git reset, which moves the branch pointer to a previous commit, git revert preserves the commit history by adding a new commit that reverses the changes of a specified commit. This is particularly useful in collaborative environments where maintaining a clear history is important.

In the case of git reset, we were deleting the commit history, what if we just want to revert the changes of the latest commit or want to revert to a specific commit, but also keep the old commits for tracking purposes?



```
git revert <commit-hash>
```

After Revert: The history of commits was maintained, but our code was also reverted to the commit we wanted
