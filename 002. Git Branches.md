### Git Branches:

Think of branches like parallel universes of your code. Each branch is a separate line of development where you can work without affecting the main/original version.

**What is a Branch?**

1. It's like creating a copy of your code where you can make changes safely
2. The main branch (usually called main or master) is like your "official" version
3. Other branches are like experimental versions where you try new things

Note: When we do `git init` a new master branch gets created.

### Branch Names and Pointers - Basic Concept:

1. A branch name is like a sticky note that points to a specific commit
2. The pointer automatically moves forward when you make new commits
3. HEAD is a special pointer that shows which branch you're currently on

Say you are currently on the `master ` branch, whenever you make a new commit, this master branch pointer will move forward to point to your latest commit.

### Check on which branch you are currently:
```
git branch
* <will show the branch name>
```

### Create a new branch and move to that branch:
To create a new branch from the current branch you are currently at :
```
git branch <branch-name>
```
This command will just create the branch, you will still be on the branch you are currently on.
To switch to your newly created branch you can do :

```
git switch <branch-name>
```

**If you don't want to do the above in 2 steps , first create the branch and then switch to it, you can also do**
```
git switch <new-branch-name>
```
If this new-branch-name does not exist a new branch will be created out of the branch you are currently on.
