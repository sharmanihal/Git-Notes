### Git Restore

If you want to discard your changes and want to restore the file to the last commit.

1. If you want to restore a staged file (Stage -> Unstage -> Discard)

   ```
   git restore --staged <file> // this will unstage the file
   //after unstaging 
   git restore <file>
   ```

2. If the file is unstaged (Unstage -> Discard)

   ```
   git restore <file>
   equal to
   git restore --worktree <file>
   ```
3. Restore working tree (All unstaged files)
   
   ```
   git restore .
   equal to
   git restore --worktree .
   ```
### Restore all your codebase back to the latest commit (restore all unstaged and staged)

```
git restore --staged --worktree .
```

---
### Source of restore: 
We know that if we restore, it will restore to the HEAD (Last commit i.e., lastest commit)

We can also specify the source of the restore point.

1. Commit tree
   ```
   git log --oneline
   ```
   
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18ba9a3c-65a0-4446-af73-71ca89f5fb1e)

2. Restore the file from the source:
   ```
   git restore --source=<commit-hash> <file-name>
   ```
   
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/351e158c-2b39-4650-b13b-62bf8548f119)

3. Restore everything for a specific source
   ```
   git restore --source = <commit-hash> .
   ```

4. Go back to x number from HEAD as source
   ```
   git restore --source =HEAD~<x>
   ```
