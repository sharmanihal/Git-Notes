### Git Diff

Simply running ```git diff``` will show the difference between the currently working directory(unstaged) and the last commit.

**Just want to see the difference between one file:**

```
git diff <file-name>
```

**If you want to compare two commits:**

```
git diff commit1 commit2
```


**Compare two branches:**

```
git diff branch1 branch2
```

**If you want to see the difference between the file staged and file committed:**
```
git diff --staged
```

**If I want to see diff irrespective of staged or not:**

```
git diff HEAD
```
