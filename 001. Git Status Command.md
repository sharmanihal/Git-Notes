### Git Status:
To run git commands we first need to make our local repo a git local repo.
**To do that we can use the below command:**
```
git init
```

This command creates a .git hidden directory. The .git folder, also known as the Git directory, is a vital part of Git repositories and is used to manage version history, track changes, and facilitate collaboration

After this initialization you now run the status command
```
git status
```

The git status command shows the current state of your Git repository, including the working directory and staging area:
1. Working directory: Where your code is stored locally
2. Staging area: Where changes are stored before being pushed to a remote repository 


Initially, when you run ```git status``` in your newly created repo, you will get the message:
```
On branch master
No commit yet
```

Now let's say we create 2 new files: ` index.html `, and ` login.html ` in our repo:
```
On branch master
No commit yet
Untracked files:
  home.html
  login.html
```

### What is git commit?

**What is a Commit?**

It's like taking a photograph of your code at a specific moment
**Each commit saves:**

- What files changed
- What changes were made
- Who made the changes
- When the changes were made
- A message explaining why the changes were made

**Basic Commit Process:**

**Git Add:** This add command will add these untracked files to a staging area, and when we commit these files will be committed i.e., added to our snapshot.

```
# First, add files you want to commit 
git add filename1.txt filename2.txt   # Add specific file
git add .              # Add all changed files

# Then create the commit
git commit -m "Your message explaining the changes"
```

Let's say you accidentally added some files to your staging area using the git add command and now you want to make it untracked again, you can do that using:

```
git rm --cached <file-name>
```

**Why are git commits required?**

Say you want to revert back to the state of your project where some features were working well. You can jump back to that commit snapshot. This is where commit comes in handy.

### Add and Commit at the same time:

```
git commit -am "commit-message"
```

### Git Log: History of all Commits:

```
git log
```
