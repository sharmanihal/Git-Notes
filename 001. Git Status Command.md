### Git Status:
To run this command we first need to make out local repo a git local repo.
**To do that we can use the below command:**
```
git init
```

This command creates a .git hidden directory. The .git folder, also known as the Git directory, is a vital part of Git repositories and is used to manage version history, track changes, and facilitate collaboration

After this initilization you now run the status command
```
git status
```

The git status command shows the current state of your Git repository, including the working directory and staging area:
1. Working directory: Where your code is stored locally
2. Staging area: Where changes are stored before being pushed to a remote repository
